_Note: Some patches require specific DLCs or mods to be loaded. The mod checks for mod compatibility but does not verify DLC content - enabling DLC-related features without the corresponding DLC may cause errors._

_All settings changes require a restart to take effect due to the minimal patching approach used by this mod._
